                    <h4><b>Reflection</b></h4>
                    <p> I think the reason that my nose, eyes, etc. look so big compared to my ears in the up close selfie is because of the perspective distortion that happens close to the camera lens. Meaning features closer to the camera lens are more exaggerated than features further from the camera lens.
                        That is also why when I step away from the camera and instead uses zoom I look more flattened. As a side note I also think that the reason I/we look more natural in selfies taken further away but with zoom than in selfies taken up close is because that is how we perceive each other in daily life. </p>

                    <p>I think the reason for the flattened look in the picture taken with zoom is because the distance between faraway objects don't differ much in distance relative to the camera.</p>
